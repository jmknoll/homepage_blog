Google has won the search game. Forever. 

On the surface, that feels like a pretty bold claim. After all, their 400B+ valuation in what is still a fast-growing industry makes them a pretty juicy target. So it seems a bit simple-minded to suggest that they will never have any meaningful competition in the search game. 

But that's just the reality of the situation. They have such incredible depth and breadth of knowledge in the field, the smartest people in the field constantly working to improve the product, an unlimited budget, and an endless network of contacts and relationships. And the product that most of us are using is free! There is simply no way that any company or individual can compete.

The good news is though, that you don't have to. Search is done. 

Search is moving away from the web, and into apps. From there, its harder to say where it could move, but it will either become a device-based functionality (think a more advanced Siri), or will drive predictive analytics that the end user won't even be aware of most of the time.

But that's for the future. Lets look at the past, and at the present. Five years ago, if I wanted to go out for dinner with a friend, I got all of my information from Google. I searched for some sort of listing of restaurants in my area. Then I ran a few searches about the restarant, maybe to find a menu or a review. Then I Googled directions on how to get the place. May have even used gmail chat to finalize the plan. 

Now things have become more segregated, but also much easier for the end user. The entire interaction happens on my smartphone. I use Yelp to find a restaurant and the reviews, Google maps for directions (actually I would use Baidu maps, because I'm in Shanghai), and then What's App to finalize the plans. 

The important things to note are that in the second version, I didn't open Chrome, I didn't really use Google search, and I wasn't served any advertisements by Google. That's very troubling news for a company whose entire revenue comes from serving ads against search. 

Note that this isn't some future fantasy, this is the way that the world already is, especially in the developing world. I would be very concerned about this trend if I were in Google's shoes.
